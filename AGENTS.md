# AGENTS entrypoint

This tracked file is a lightweight pointer.

## Source of truth

If `.agents/AGENTS.md` exists locally, read and follow it first. That private
file is the authoritative instruction set for this repository.

## Fallback behavior

If `.agents/AGENTS.md` is missing, use `README.md`, `package.json` scripts, and
inline code comments as the baseline guidance.
